1. The Application and Functionality
Provide an overview of the application‚Äôs purpose, core features, and how it works.

Overview:
The Task Manager is a web application that helps users keep track of their tasks. Users can:

Add new tasks with titles and due dates.
Mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
Delete tasks.
View tasks with different priority levels (e.g., Low, Medium, High).
The application uses confetti as a fun visual effect when a task is marked as completed.
Features:
Task Creation: Add new tasks with titles, due dates, and priorities.
Task Completion: Mark tasks as completed with a simple click. Completed tasks are visually marked with a line-through effect.
Task Deletion: Remove tasks from the list.
Priority System: Tasks have different priority levels (Low, Medium, High), represented with emojis (üî∞, ‚ö†Ô∏è, üî•).
Confetti Effect: When a task is marked as completed, a confetti animation is triggered across the page to celebrate the task completion.
